Utilized the file naming convention of ( 1_ , 2_ ..}, please follow along the examples accordingly. I created the additional PDF files to capture more details related to specific coding logic explanations as well as to enhance the domain knowledge. Also provided screenshots in some cases so that you can verify the results.<br>

First follow along the Python implementation of Graph logic (<b>1_Graph_introduction.ipnyb</b>) to understand the basic relationships in a graph. Then follow along the rest of the guide to implement Neo4j database utilization to create the same structures we learned in the introductory Python implementation and user Cipher queries to query the database. Complete guide to this included in the PDF files provided.<br>

Neo4j implementations:<br>
<b>(1) UNIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS: [FRIENDS_WITH]</b><br>
    users, friendship_pairs  -  This relationship was implemented as u1 -> u2 ONLY. Follow along the scripts and Cipher command files correspondingly.<br>

<b>(2) BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS: [FIRENDS_WITH2]</b><br>
    users2, friendship_pairs2  - This relationship was implemented as u1 -> u2 and u2 -> u1. Follow along the scripts and Cipher command files correspondingly.<br>
